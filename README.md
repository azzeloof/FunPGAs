# FunPGAs

This is the code repo for an introduction to FPGAs, written by Adam Zeloof for a couple of his friends.

This is very much a work in progress, and Adam is very much not an expert, so things may be wrong. Okay, things will be wrong.

Examples in this repo are designed for the IceBreaker FPGA board, unless otherwise noted. The makefiles were copied from the [icebreaker-verilog-examples](https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker-verilog-examples) repo.
